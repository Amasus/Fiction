clarity idea: make all time references from current point? e.g. meeting is 'a little over a year ago', movie is '12 months ago, only a month after meeting'. Actually, you're already using a single point as a reference in each of the three sections - first hotel room, rainy goat evening, and first/last line. Making sure each of those points is clearly established relative to the others, and the relative timelines are right seems good for delineation.
