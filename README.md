# Fiction
Writings. Mostly in LaTex

## Short stories
What you expect. Mostly finished. May need polishing

## Longer works
These remain unfinished. Mostly because I lack the confidence in my ability to carry a story to believe that they are worth completing. Working on that.

Also time. Writing is inevitably a race between my my ability to carve out space to write and the demons in my head who say that my output isn't worth the effort. Working on this one too, though the answer is less clear.
